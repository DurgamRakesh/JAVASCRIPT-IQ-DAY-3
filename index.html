    <p>15.How many operators do we have in JS ?</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS, we have 6 types of operators and they are:
        1.Aithmatic operators : + , - , * , / , %
        2.Comparison operators : == , === , != , !== , < , <= , > , >=
        3.Logical operators : && , || , !
        4.Assignment operators : = , += , -= , *= , /= , %=
        5.Conditional operators : =
        6.Ternary operators: ? :

    <p>16.What are arrow functions?</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS, Arrow functions are also called as "fat arrow"(=>) functions.
        -Arrow functions are new way of writing functions in js without using function keyword and return keyword.
        -It was introduced in ES6.
        -We are omit curly braces and function and return keyword.
        -Arrow functions are assigned to a variable.

        EX:
        let arrow = (a,b) => a*b;
        console.log(arrow(5,6));
    </pre>
    <p>17.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN?</p>
    <pre>
        Undefined:
        Means  a variable declated but not assigned any value.
        var a; 

        Not defined:
        Means the variable is yet declated.
        -It indicates that accessed variable does not exist in the memory
        so it will give undefined.
        console.log(a);

        NaN: stands for Not a Number. it is a special value of the NaN property of global object.
        -NaN indicates a failed operation on number.
        -isNaN() function to check if a value is NaN.
    </pre>
    <p>18.What is callback hell?</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS, Callback hell is function with nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug
        when dealing with ansychronus logic.
        -The callback hell looks like pyramid structure.
        EX:
        setTimeout(()=>{
            console.log(1);
            setTimeout(()=>{
                console.log(2);
                setTimeout(()=>{
                    console.log(3);
                },3000);
            },2000);
        },1000);
    </pre>
    <p>19.Please explain Self Invoking Function and its code?</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS, An IIFE(immediatly Invoked function expression) is a javascript function that runs as soon
        as it declated.()().
        -Also known as self Invoking function anonymous function.

        EX:
        (function self(){
            console.log('this is IIFE function')
        })()

        -The primary reason for to use this IIFE is to obtain data privacy.
        because any variable declated with IIFE cannot accessed outside of function.
        if we try it will give error
    </pre>
    <p>20.What is the use of setTimeout?</p>
    <pre>
        The setTimeout() method executes a function or block of code after the specified time expires.
        -The method execute the code only once.

        SYNTAX: setTimeout(function,time);

        EX:
        setTimeout(()=>{
            console.log('this is setTimeout function')
        },5000)
